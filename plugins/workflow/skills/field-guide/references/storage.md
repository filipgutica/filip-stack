# Field guide storage

Use `~/.field-guide` unless the utility receives an explicit `--guide-root`.

Use these terms:

- A **review record** stores evidence for one correction commit.
- A **project pattern** stores durable project guidance.
- **Shared guidance** stores a promoted cross-project preference.

```text
~/.field-guide/
├── init.md
├── shared/
└── projects/
    └── <repo-key>/
        ├── init.md
        ├── patterns.md
        └── reviews/
```

## Indexes

Every Markdown file below the guide root must be reachable from the nearest index:

- Root `init.md` links each shared topic and project `init.md`, with a one-line description.
- Project `init.md` links `patterns.md` and every review record, with a one-line description.
- Keep indexes concise. Do not copy the linked file contents into the index.

## Review record

Use one record per correction commit. A record may contain multiple review rounds that led to that commit.

```md
# <concise learning title>

- Date: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Repository: `<repository name>`
- Branch: `<branch>`
- Commit: `<full 40-character hash>`
- Commit link: <URL or `not available`>
- Review source: <pull-request URL, comment URL, user review, or other concise source>
- Outcome: `accepted` or `modified`

## Review rounds

### Round 1

- Feedback: <what was challenged>
- Evaluation: <why it was valid and how it applied here>
- Change: <what changed>
- Verification: <focused evidence>

## Durable learning

- Lesson: <generalized preference or anti-pattern>
- Scope: `project` or `shared`
- Guidance file: <relative link to patterns.md or shared topic>
```

Replace every placeholder before saving the record.

Use `accepted` when the change applies the feedback as given. Use `modified` when the implementation adapts it.

Omit later review rounds when there was only one.

## Project patterns

Keep `patterns.md` organized by stable topic. Each project pattern states:

- the preferred pattern or anti-pattern
- when it applies
- a link to at least one supporting review record.

When later evidence changes a pattern, update the guidance and retain the historical review records.

## Shared promotion

Create a focused file under `shared/` only for cross-project guidance.

Promote a preference immediately when the user states that it is general. Otherwise, require committed evidence from two project guides.

Record one of these evidence shapes near the top of the shared file:

```md
- Promotion: `explicit-general-preference`
- Preference source: <where the user stated the general preference>
```

```md
- Promotion: `multi-project-evidence`

## Evidence

- [<first project review>](../projects/<repo-key>/reviews/<record>.md)
- [<second project review>](../projects/<repo-key>/reviews/<record>.md)
```

Multi-project evidence must link indexed review records from two project guides. Keep both repositories available during validation.

The utility verifies commits, promotion data, evidence links, and related local Markdown links.

Project-specific contracts and conventions stay in that project's `patterns.md`, even when they recur within one repository.
